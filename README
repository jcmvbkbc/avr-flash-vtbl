This is a super minimalistic GCC plugin that makes avr-g++ put tables of
vitual functions into the program memory saving RAM. It is meant to be
built as a plugin for the existing avr-g++ and modify its default behavior
when loaded.

Building.

To build this plugin you need avr-g++ with plugins directory installed
and the host gcc. Just run make in the current directory.

Using.

Invoke avr-g++ with additional parameter

  -fplugin=<full-path-to>/avr-flash-vtbl.so

More technical info.

This plugin merely adds __flash attribute to the C++ vtable and vtable
pointer types. The rest is taken care of by the existing address space
machinery of the gcc and flash address space support of the AVR backend.
